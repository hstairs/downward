# Fast Downward Grounding System

This is the grounder of Fast-Downward. 
Below information are inherited by the original repository, kept here to give the right credit to the vast amount of work done on this amazing planning system.

Yet, this repository focuses on the grounding mechanism used by Fast-Downward.

The grounder is tested with a plain installation of python3.8; though it can work with other versions, too.

To run the grounder you need to type the following:

'python translate/translate.py domain problem' 

where domain and problem are two filenames representing the PDDL description of the domain and the problem.

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates
code and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi Röger and Silvia Richter.
